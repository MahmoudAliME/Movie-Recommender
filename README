SUMMARY
================================================================================

A movie recommendation system using three different approaches: content-based filtering, item-based collaborative filtering, and a machine learning approach. The code reads in data from several CSV files, merges the dataframes, extracts features such as genres and user demographics, and calculates similarity scores based on these features.

The content-based filtering approach calculates the similarity score between a selected movie and other movies based on their genres. The item-based collaborative filtering approach creates a user-item matrix and calculates the cosine similarity between movies to provide recommendations. The machine learning approach preprocesses user demographics and uses a label encoder to transform state names into numerical values.

Overall, the code seems to be implementing a solid approach to movie recommendation using various techniques, and it appears that you have provided some data preprocessing steps to prepare the data for analysis. However, without the data or specific problem statement, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness or accuracy of the recommendation system.
